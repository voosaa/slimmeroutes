### 1. Project Breakdown

**App Name:** RoutePlanner Pro  
**Platform:** Web  
**Summary:** RoutePlanner Pro is a user-friendly web application designed to help businesses optimize their weekly customer visits. By entering destination addresses, the app automatically generates the most efficient and cost-effective routes, considering distance and optimal travel time. The app integrates real-time traffic updates, dynamic pricing models, and multi-stop route optimization to ensure businesses save time and reduce costs. With a clean and intuitive interface, RoutePlanner Pro simplifies route planning and provides actionable insights through reporting and analytics.  

**Primary Use Case:**  
- Businesses with field teams (e.g., sales, delivery, or service teams) that need to plan weekly customer visits efficiently.  
- Users input multiple destination addresses, and the app generates optimized routes, factoring in real-time traffic and distance.  

**Authentication Requirements:**  
- Email/password authentication for user accounts.  
- Optional OAuth integration (e.g., Google or GitHub) for streamlined sign-up.  
- Role-based access control (e.g., admin vs. regular user) for managing business accounts.

### 2. Tech Stack Overview

**Frontend Framework:** React + Next.js  
- React for building reusable UI components.  
- Next.js for server-side rendering (SSR), static site generation (SSG), and API routes.  

**UI Library:** Tailwind CSS + ShadCN  
- Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling and rapid UI development.  
- ShadCN for pre-built, customizable UI components (e.g., buttons, modals, forms).  

**Backend (BaaS): Supabase**  
- Supabase for PostgreSQL database storage, real-time updates, and authentication.  
- Supabase Edge Functions for serverless backend logic (e.g., route optimization calculations).  

**Deployment:** Vercel  
- Vercel for seamless deployment, automatic scaling, and CI/CD integration.

### 3. Core Features

1. **Address Autocomplete:**  
   - Integrate Google Places API to provide real-time address suggestions as users type.  
   - Store frequently used addresses in Supabase for quick retrieval.  

2. **Multi-stop Route Optimization:**  
   - Use Google Maps API to calculate distances and travel times between multiple destinations.  
   - Implement an algorithm (e.g., Dijkstra's or A*) to optimize the order of stops.  

3. **Real-time Traffic Updates:**  
   - Fetch live traffic data from Google Maps API to adjust routes dynamically.  

4. **Dynamic Pricing Model:**  
   - Calculate estimated fuel costs based on distance and current fuel prices.  
   - Provide cost breakdowns for each route.  

5. **Reporting and Analytics:**  
   - Generate weekly reports on total distance traveled, time saved, and cost efficiency.  
   - Visualize data using charts (e.g., bar charts, pie charts) with libraries like Chart.js.  

6. **User-friendly Interface:**  
   - Clean, responsive design with drag-and-drop functionality for reordering stops.  
   - Intuitive dashboard for managing routes and viewing analytics.

### 4. User Flow

1. **Sign Up/Login:**  
   - User creates an account or logs in via email/password or OAuth.  

2. **Dashboard:**  
   - User lands on a dashboard displaying saved routes, recent activity, and analytics.  

3. **Create New Route:**  
   - User inputs destination addresses using the address autocomplete feature.  
   - User can drag and drop stops to reorder them manually.  

4. **Optimize Route:**  
   - User clicks "Optimize Route" to generate the most efficient sequence of stops.  
   - App displays the optimized route with distance, travel time, and cost estimates.  

5. **View Real-time Traffic Updates:**  
   - User can toggle real-time traffic updates to see live adjustments to the route.  

6. **Save and Share Route:**  
   - User saves the route to their account or shares it with team members via a unique link.  

7. **View Reports:**  
   - User accesses weekly reports to analyze performance metrics.

### 5. Design and UI/UX Guidelines

- **Color Scheme:**  
  - Primary: Blue (#3B82F6) for trust and professionalism.  
  - Secondary: Gray (#6B7280) for neutral elements.  
  - Accent: Green (#10B981) for success and efficiency.  

- **Typography:**  
  - Headings: Inter (Bold, 24px).  
  - Body Text: Inter (Regular, 16px).  

- **Layout:**  
  - Grid-based layout for consistent spacing.  
  - Sidebar for navigation (e.g., dashboard, routes, reports).  
  - Main content area for route planning and analytics.  

- **Accessibility:**  
  - Ensure all components are keyboard-navigable.  
  - Use ARIA labels for screen readers.  
  - High-contrast color combinations for readability.

### 6. Technical Implementation Approach

1. **Frontend (React + Next.js):**  
   - Use React hooks (e.g., `useState`, `useEffect`) for state management.  
   - Implement API routes in Next.js to handle Google Maps API requests.  
   - Use ShadCN components for modals, forms, and buttons.  

2. **Backend (Supabase):**  
   - Store user data, saved routes, and analytics in Supabase PostgreSQL tables.  
   - Use Supabase Auth for user authentication and role-based access control.  
   - Leverage Supabase Edge Functions for route optimization logic.  

3. **UI (Tailwind CSS):**  
   - Style components using Tailwind utility classes (e.g., `bg-blue-500`, `p-4`).  
   - Customize ShadCN components with Tailwind for a cohesive design.  

4. **Deployment (Vercel):**  
   - Connect the GitHub repository to Vercel for automatic deployments.  
   - Configure environment variables for API keys (e.g., Google Maps API).
